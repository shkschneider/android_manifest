> A modest custom ROM based off [AOSP](https://android.googlesource.com/) with minimal modifications.

I started cooking ROMs with _Android 2.2 FroYo_ and _Android 2.3 Gingerbread_ mainly.
Over the years, I felt more and more satisfied with the community's work, yet the stock "pure" Nexus experience was more and more pleasant by itself.

Android getting more and more mature, starting with _Android 6.0 Marshmallow_ (and its _Material Design_), I felt like having a stock "pure" Nexus experience, while having root, could be enough for me.

I was wrong: it lacked tiny things here and there. So I made this modest ROM with the few things I missed from the custom ROMs. And that is enough for me.
